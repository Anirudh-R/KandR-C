These are solutions for the exercises in K&R C book, 2nd edition.

These have been tested on the online compiler at https://www.onlinegdb.com

Exercises 7.6 to 7.8 have been tested on Code::Blocks 16.01 (GNU GCC Compiler) on Windows 10.

Exercises 8.1 to 8.8 have been tested on Code::Blocks 16.01 (GNU GCC Compiler) on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

These solutions have been written by myself with a little help from the book 'The C Answer Book', 2nd edition.
